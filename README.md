# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹


I made this app when I was learning about Dart programming concepts and open source Flutter packages - A part of Angela Yu's Flutter course. 

It's a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.
